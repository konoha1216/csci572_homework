A Short Summary of The Result: My search engine is "Bing". For the search results I get with the 100 queries, by comparing them with the google search results given by the professor. The overlapping rate is 31.6%, meaning the search results between these two engines are quite different, in my viewpoint. The average Spearman coefficient is -8.87(keep two decimals), it's less than zero, meaning the rankings between these two engines are negative or dissimilar. In summary, based on my query results, we can conclude that the "Bing" and "Google" are very different in term of searching results.
