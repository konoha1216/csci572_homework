How Medicine Became the Stealth Family-Friendly Profession
Female doctors are more likely than other professionals to have children and keep working. The reasons offer lessons for other jobs.

Britni Hebert was chief resident, on track for a career in the highly demanding field of oncology, when she found out she was having twins. “Everything kind of just tilted on its head,” she said. 
She couldn’t imagine 80-hour workweeks with two newborns at home, while her husband was doing an equally intensive radiology fellowship. But she didn’t leave the profession. Instead, Dr. Hebert, 37, decided to practice internal medicine and geriatrics, with more control over her hours. She has been able to change her schedule three times as her family’s needs have changed (the twins are 6, and the couple has a baby), and now works about 85 percent of full-time hours. 
Medicine has become something of a stealth family-friendly profession, at a time when other professions are growing more greedy about employees’ time. Jobs increasingly require long, inflexible hours, and pay disproportionately more to people who work them. But if one parent is on call at work, someone else has to be on call at home. For most couples, that’s the woman — which is why educated women are being pushed out of work or into lower-paying jobs. 
But medicine has changed in ways that offer doctors and other health care workers the option of more control over their hours, depending on the specialty and job they choose, while still practicing at the top of their training and being paid proportionately. 
Women are now half of medical students. In some specialties, like pediatrics, geriatrics and child psychiatry, they are the majority. Female doctors are likelier than women with law degrees, business degrees or doctorates to have children. They’re also much less likely to stop working when they do. 
Flexible, predictable hours are the key — across occupations — to shrinking gender gaps, according to the body of research by Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard. As American employers struggle to adapt to the realities of modern family life and as younger generations of workers demand more balance, medicine offers a road map. 
Dr. Hebert, who lives in Lafayette, La., estimates that forgoing oncology halved her lifelong earnings. But she’s grateful that she had other options for practicing medicine — and can still meet her children at the school bus most afternoons. 
“I don’t want to pretend there aren’t sacrifices that come with the path that I’ve chosen,” she said, “but I just don’t think I could be employed at this time if not for being able to decide my schedule.” 
A happy consequence
Most of what changed in medicine had little to do with making it easier for parents, especially women, to work; family friendliness was a happy consequence.
A generation ago, the typical doctor owned a private practice, and saw patients whenever they got sick. Today, doctors are much likelier to work for large group practices or hospitals and be on call at predictable times. Seventy percent of doctors under 40 are now employees, not owners, according to American Medical Association data. So are the majority of female doctors of all ages. 
Large group practices are more profitable because they can share resources, like clinic space or physician assistants, and more easily negotiate with health insurance plans. 
But the setup also gives doctors more work-life balance, because there are more people who can serve as substitutes and divide night and weekend work. 
“The old market expectation that your doctor will be available at all hours and is entirely flexible was beginning to fall apart as the work force became more diverse,” said Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “New generations look at the work-life balance of older generations of physicians, and I think many of them say, ‘I don’t want that.’” 
Dr. Wachter was responsible for naming one of the jobs that exemplifies this shift: hospitalist, the physician who sees patients who are hospitalized and coordinates with the specialists caring for them. They also make doctors’ schedules predictable, because hospitalists work in shifts, and primary care physicians don’t have to go to the hospital when their patients do. Other occupations have also come to rely on substitutes, like pharmacists and real estate agents (and in rare cases, some lawyers and management consultants). 
Sara Gonzalez, 37, a pediatrician in Dartmouth, Mass., works as a hospitalist and in the emergency department, another shift job. She usually works 10 eight-hour shifts a month, with a few 16-hour overnights. When she’s off, she’s responsible for anything that comes up with her 1-year-old daughter; when she’s at the hospital, her wife, who works in marketing, is the on-call parent. 
“When my shift changes, I hand off my patients to the next provider, and that’s a really nice thing to not be on call when I walk out of the hospital,” Dr. Gonzalez said. “It gives me a great deal of control over my schedule, especially since I have these other interests, which were initially travel and have now shifted to family.” 
The internet helps. Electronic medical records enable any doctor to see a patient’s history. Some use telemedicine to see patients who don’t require a physical exam. In the case of radiology, the entire job can be done remotely. 
Julia Dry Knarreborg, 42, a radiologist in Edmond, Okla., and a mother, works from home, reading scans from patients in several states. She is paid by the day, and can add shifts when she wants. If she needs to leave midday, she can request that no emergency scans come through for that period, and catch up on nonemergency scans when she returns.
“You have total freedom to do what needs to be done for your family,” she said, “without the stigma associated with a working mom — ‘Oh, she’s got to go again, her kid is sick or she has another prenatal appointment.’” 
The power of part-time
There are other things that can make it easier to be a mother and a doctor, like earning enough to afford good child care and household help. But the rise in predictable hours is a major reason more women have entered medicine, and young women are opting for lower-hour specialties more than in the past, Ms. Goldin’s analysis of data from the Community Tracking Study Physician Survey and the American Medical Association shows. Specialties with shorter hours and fewer emergencies, like dermatology, attract more women; those with long, inflexible hours, like cardiology, have more men. 
Women under 45 also work fewer hours than men in the same specialty — an average of 48.1 hours a week compared with men’s 58.5, she found. 
Yee-Yie Fogarty, 45, is a radiation oncologist at a large health care system in Northern California, and a mother of four. She works 80 percent of full time — and is paid 80 percent of what she would if she worked full time. 
“When I’m here four days a week, I feel I can work at 100 percent of my abilities,” she said. “I do feel in my heart it is sacred work.” 
Female doctors are paid 67 percent of what men are, but much of the gap is because they work less. After considering their hours, their specialty and the years they’ve been doctors, the gap shrinks to 82 percent, Ms. Goldin found. (Also adjusting for hours and age, full-time female financial analysts make 77 percent of what men do; lawyers make 82 percent; and computer engineers make 88 percent.) 
While a part-time lawyer makes disproportionately less than a full-time one, doctors who work reduced schedules tend to be paid more proportionally. (The remaining pay gap, she said, is partly because women’s reduced hours earlier in their careers might have long-term consequences, like being passed over for grants or leadership positions). 
Hours — and not other factors like women’s preferences for certain specialties or employers’ preferences for whom to hire — directly influenced female doctors’ career choices, found another economist, Melanie Wasserman at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2003, medical residencies capped the number of hours residents could work and mandated time off. In response, more women entered specialties that had been more time-intensive, like surgery and neurology. (Men did not make different choices because of the change in hours). She also found evidence that fertility rates increased for women in specialties with shortened hours. 
The findings offer a broader lesson, Ms. Wasserman said: “If employers are serious about improving gender diversity in their work force, they might want to think seriously about how they are structuring their jobs.” 
The cost of flexibility
Female doctors face the same challenges that other female workers do — including sexual harassment, discrimination and inadequate parental leave — and some specific to medicine. Even doctors with predictable schedules may work nights and weekends, can’t easily leave midday and often feel a drive to be available anytime their patients need them. 
Training is arduous, expensive and long, and usually overlaps with the prime childbearing years, so many female doctors struggle with fertility and carry onerous student debt. Some might choose a specialty before they have children, then have a hard time switching to a more flexible job if they want to. And some of the ways in which medicine has changed have made it harder to balance work and family — like the time consumed by electronic medical records — so doctors are experiencing increasing rates of burnout. 
“There are so many sacrifices that women physicians make in order to remain in their careers, remain working, things that aren’t taken into consideration when looking at how wonderful and flexible it can be,” said Aisha Haynie Smart, 41, a hospital medical director near Houston.
For her training, she said, she moved far from her family and delayed marriage and pregnancy. In her current job, she misses directly caring for patients. But she can leave midday or work remotely if needed — and unlike when she worked as a hospitalist and emergency doctor, she never misses a family dinner or her son’s Saturday swim lesson. 
“I feel lucky in the sense that there were different options available,” she said.
There’s a downside when women cluster in certain specialties: In general, when a field becomes female-dominated, its pay and prestige drops. The risk of creating alternate, stunted career paths for women is “an issue that’s plaguing the labor force and companies in general,” Ms. Goldin said. “It is a risk throughout that solutions today become a problem tomorrow.” 
One possibility — which could help alleviate this problem — is that more men will also choose less time-intensive specialties and ask for predictable hours. There’s evidence that’s happening. This year, 80 percent of male medical school graduates said work-life balance had a strong or moderate influence on their choice of specialty (up from 70 percent a decade ago, when the question was first asked), according to the Association of American Medical Colleges’ annual survey of graduates. 
Doctors who teach in medical schools say the desire for work-life balance is generational, not just for women. 
“Men are asking for time off, too,” said Lydia Pleotis Howell, chair of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of California, Davis. “It’s changing the workplace, and employers have to respond to that.” 
In many professions, employers insist that the work is so important that one lawyer or consultant, for example, must be available for a particular client 24/7. But if doctors have figured out how to work predictable hours and substitute for one another — for things like delivering babies, diagnosing diseases or saving lives — couldn’t other occupations, too? 
Dr. Hebert, the internist in Louisiana, said for her and her physician husband, substitutes have been the key to making it all work — both at home and in their practices. They moved to her hometown, where extended family live nearby and can help with the children on short notice, and a nanny watches their baby. Almost all her partners at work have children, which she said is crucial because they understand what she’s dealing with. 
“We jump at the chance to help each other, because we know we might need help,” Dr. Hebert said. “This enables me to meet the needs of the patient population I love, while being able to care for my family.”

Martinis at the Bar. Sinatra on Repeat. The TWA Hotel Sells a Jet-Age Fantasy.
Our architecture critic finds not quite enough polish at the new hotel in Eero Saarinen’s 1962 TWA Flight Center, despite glamour to spare. 
Checking Out the TWA Hotel

	July 1, 2019
Within the first couple of weeks there were half a dozen marriage proposals. Guys dropping to their knees in the Sunken Lounge and on the cantilevered catwalk — popping the question on the Solari split-flap departure board or in “Connie,” the 1958 TWA Lockheed Constellation Starliner parked outside on the roof of a new underground conference center, the plane’s fuselage converted into a 60’s-era cocktail lounge.
The TWA Hotel now occupies Eero Saarinen’s stupendously restored 1962 TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport, midcentury modernism’s great tribute to sex, adventure and the golden age of air travel. It is attracting the predictable mix of nostalgic baby boomers, design-conscious hipsters and stylish Europeans. 
[This story is part of our package about Queens, New York City’s most diverse borough. It also includes 36 Hours in Rockaway Beach, and a whirlwind tour of the Queens food scene.]
My wife and I caught the A train to Kennedy and stayed the other night, during what TWA’s owner is calling the hotel’s soft opening — his explanation for what has clearly been a rough start. Power outages, failed air-conditioning in the rooms, broken window blinds, televisions that don’t work, a food court shut down by the Health Department: the place is a work in progress. 
There are 512 new rooms in two plain seven-story towers designed by a Brooklyn architecture firm, Lubrano Ciavarra, linked to the Flight Center via Saarinen’s red-carpeted tubular jetways, their exteriors clad in curtain walls of reflective black glass to mirror Saarinen’s building. An infinity pool, with a bird’s-eye view of planes taking off and landing, occupies the rooftop of one tower.
Saarinen’s building is the hotel atrium, with bars, shops and the latest Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant. Richard Southwick, from Beyer Blinder Belle, the New York architects, oversaw its restoration. He deserves a key to the city. I watched people walk around as if in a trance, snapping selfies, pointing and gazing at the thin, vaulted, soaring, twin-tortoise-shell concrete roof, breathing deeply, to inhale the building’s aura, lingering because, well, just being in that space seems to inspire happiness.
When was the last time you lingered for pleasure at Kennedy Airport? When was the last time you felt happy to be there? An architectural advertisement for the thrill of air travel at the sunny dawn of the jet age, Saarinen’s reincarnated terminal is an unavoidable reminder of just how sad and degrading the experience of flying has become, if you’re not rich. 
Some history: In 1955, the architect Wallace Harrison came up with a master plan for what was then called Idlewild Airport. It prescribed stand-alone terminals built and run by competing airlines encircling a traffic loop. The plan was a kind of recipe for architectural scene-stealing. During its early years, Kennedy boasted the world’s longest continuous cocktail lounge (in the since-demolished American Airlines terminal designed by Kahn and Jacobs), and Tippett-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton’s (now also sadly demolished) 1960 Worldport for Pan Am, the architectural analog to Marilyn Monroe’s billowing skirt in “The Seven Year Itch.”

The 1950s and 60s were the days before airline deregulation, when the government still set ticket prices. So airlines competed not over who could offer the cheapest, no-frills fares but over who could offer the best-dressed flight attendants, the most scrumptious Chateaubriand on the plane and the best terminal experience. Back then, Howard Hughes’s TWA was the nation’s glamour carrier, the Veronica Lake of airlines. Hughes is said to have spent his five minutes with Saarinen demanding something truly out of this world — money being no object. 
Saarinen earned his spurs conjuring up a raft of rectilinear behemoths for big companies and swooping spectacles of sculptural engineering like the St. Louis Arch, Ingalls Hockey Rink at Yale and Dulles Airport in Washington. He was a chameleon and a master of corporate branding.
For TWA, he seems to nod both toward Le Corbusier’s Ronchamp Chapel and the Las Vegas Strip. The building, an amazing feat of technological improvisation in the days before computer design, was a populist proto-emoji for flight, all free-flowing, liquid curves, improbably poised on four slender buttresses like a winged bird on skinny legs.
Its sheer formal poetry kept the aviary and female allusions from tipping into kitsch. This was high modernism at its most seductive and crowd-pleasing.
Opened a year after Saarinen died, at 51, the terminal was also obsolete from day one. Conceived while the biggest of those Constellation turboprops carried just 105 passengers, the Flight Center was born into a decade that introduced the 747, which could haul 660 souls in its maw. Notepad and stopwatch in hand, Saarinen had spent hours analyzing how people moved through airline terminals. He invented the jetway to funnel passengers more efficiently from check-in to plane, and an automated baggage carousel to return luggage quicker.
But he hadn’t anticipated the wide-body jet, for which the terminal became a useless Lilliputian. TWA’s baggage carousel had been conceived to handle only a few suitcases at a time. Between 1955 and 1962, the volume of passengers shuffling through Kennedy skyrocketed from 3.5 million to 11.5 million.
In 2002, that number reached 30 million, by which time TWA was defunct and Saarinen’s terminal, mothballed.
It sat empty while the banal Terminal 5, scaled to the jumbo-sized misery of contemporary air travel, was constructed around it, landlocking the Flight Center. Serving JetBlue, Terminal 5 spoiled what had been Saarinen’s carefully orchestrated tarmac-and-blue-sky views through the Flight Center’s huge, inclined windows.
Then in 2015 MCR, a New York development company led by Tyler Morse, won the right to lease the disused Flight Center and turn it into a hotel. Mr. Morse’s business owns and operates the High Line Hotel in Manhattan along with dozens of midrange chain hotels around the country. He saw TWA as a shrine for architecture buffs and a potential retreat for transients power-napping between flights. It lets guests rent rooms for the day as well as overnight. 
The room designs by the interior design firm Stonehill Taylor are crisp, compact and clean — pretend time capsules from 1962 — with brushed-brass fixtures, walnut paneling and floor-to-ceiling windows of 4.5-inch glass to keep out the sound of jet engines. Maybe I missed it, but I failed to locate a USB port. Each room is stocked with pole lamps, Saarinen tulip tables and womb chairs, martini glasses, cups of bright red TWA-embossed pencils and copies of Life magazine. Guests have apparently been stealing pencils and magazines by the bushel.
The economy and logic of the site suggested a large full-service airport hotel with a 21st century conference center, a ballroom and event space to compete with the Marriotts and Hyatts at major airports in other big cities.
Mr. Morse says he envisioned another audience too. Millions of people live east of the airport, in the opposite direction from Manhattan and Brooklyn. And a virtual city of employees — baggage handlers, TSA agents, pilots, flight attendants, shopkeepers, maintenance personnel and air traffic controllers — work at the airport each day. These were also potential customers. 
And, in fact, locals seem to be checking the place out. Rooms start at under $200. Ours cost $179 before taxes. When I came down from our room to the lobby for a morning coffee, I ran across an older man in a baggy tank top, Jordans and gym shorts, toting flaming red shopping bags packed with TWA swag he had bought at the new TWA store. “I can’t get enough of these!” he announced, waving a thick wad of compression socks with the TWA logo on them. He told me that he was a mover on his day off. He had taken the B15 bus to the airport and stayed overnight. Kennedy was near where he had grown up, he said. For him, the hotel was the latest attraction in his old neighborhood.
Mr. Morse plans to install a skating rink next to Connie this winter, with the expectation it will entice Queens residents. I’m reminded of the days when families went to the airport just for the joy of watching planes take off.
It’s a pity that the hotel’s opening was rushed to make the deadline for a ribbon cutting by New York’s governor, and others. The infinity pool wasn’t finished when we were there. Service was friendly but a mess. 
A little teething pain is understandable, of course, but the scrupulous attention paid up front to architectural restoration doesn’t seem to have been paid to hotel operations and customer service. Had we been jet-lagged travelers desperate for sleep, not carefree New Yorkers with an evening to spare, I doubt we would have felt as copacetic when told to kill time by buying ourselves drinks and dinner because our reserved room would not be ready until two hours after it was supposed to be.
And my wife and I weren’t the only ones whose blackout curtains — obligatory if you don’t want to be on display at night from the Flight Center — didn’t work. We spent the hour it took for a repairman to arrive thumbing through ads for Bridget Bardot bras and Plymouth Valiant cars in our copy of Life magazine from 1960. 
I called Mr. Morse. He acknowledged the hotel has handed out more than a few refunds. As a designated city landmark at the airport, the building has required approvals from some 22 government agencies, Mr. Morse told me, “all with different wants and needs and restrictions and comments.” 
He described the trials of finding grout to match exactly the original penny tile floor that isn’t slippery and doesn’t stain and discolor when it gets wet.
“We’re back to the drawing board on sealant number nine,” he said. “We’ve been at this for weeks.”
 Mr. Morse pointed out to me that 1962 was the year Sean Connery starred in “Dr. No,” the year John Glenn circled the earth, the year “The Jetsons” were on prime time television. It was the year President Kennedy challenged America to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade.
 A period Lincoln Continental is stationed outside the hotel’s front door. Cans of Tab stock the mini-fridge at the newsstand. The soundtrack is 24-hour Connie Francis and Frank Sinatra. There’s a display of TWA uniforms by Balmain and Valentino in the Ambassador Lounge, and greeters, wearing the outfits, roam around pretending to be characters from 1962. 
Nineteen-sixty-two was also the year riots erupted on the all-white campus of the University of Mississippi when a black Air Force veteran named James Meredith tried to enroll, and U.S. aircraft started spraying Agent Orange over guerrilla-occupied areas of South Vietnam.
Saarinen’s TWA was obviously selling a mostly white middle-class fantasy, the upbeat 60s, the airline beloved by Elizabeth Taylor and the Pope, who got his own gold-painted hideaway, with its own oculus, carved into a corner of Saarinen’s Ambassador Lounge. 
The hotel is a theme park for that fantasy version of 1962, though I have trouble picturing a busy corporate traveler today attending meetings at the conference center feeling charmed when a costumed employee responds with a blank stare to a request for directions to CitiField or for the hotel’s Wi-Fi passcode because there was no such thing as CitiField or Wi-Fi in 1962.
“The place will evolve,” Mr. Morse said, “like all things in the built environment. Our objective is to continue to experiment within this extraordinary piece of art.” 
Here’s hoping the experiment succeeds. It’s exhilarating to find this extraordinary piece of art back in all its glory. 
But its future now depends on the hotel finding its groove.

Red Lobster and Waffles
Casual dining chains are responding to shifts in consumer behavior in uneven ways.

By Jordan Lebeau
	May 12, 2018
My interest was piqued by a promoted tweet and fueled by dietary nihilism.
Red Lobster had announced a lobster-and-waffles special for most of April, and I couldn’t get the image of the crispy, buttermilk-battered split Maine lobster tail atop a “signature Cheddar Bay waffle” drizzled with maple syrup out of my head. My wife and I decided to try it; it was a meal we were prepared to remember, if not enjoy.
On a lazy, almost-warm Sunday last month, we drove to the Red Lobster in Woodbridge, N.J., where we were met with a 20-minute wait in a vestibule strewn with spider webs. The two of us took seats between a senior couple dressed to impress for Sunday fellowship and a young couple who smelled like a college dorm on April 20 — visions of #goals past and future.
Red Lobster’s take on chicken and waffles may not seem like a big deal, or even worthy of our patience. But, to me, it represented something of a moment. 
In general, casual dining chains like Red Lobster are in trouble. Major franchises like T.G.I. Fridays and Applebee’s have stumbled through a decade of losses, and many chains, including Friendly’s and Bennigan’s, have filed for bankruptcy. Americans have changed their dining habits: The country’s upper class has soured on paying $15 to $20 per meal for bland bar fare, and the chain sustaining middle class can no longer afford it. 
That, coupled with a widening breadth of delivery options through third-party services like Seamless and UberEats, makes the future of casual dining chains unclear. 
Restaurants have responded to this shift in consumer behavior in uneven, often stomach churning ways. For a while, Applebee’s made “a clear pendulum swing toward millennials.” The franchise updated its décor and put youthful sounding items, like a “turkey sandwich with sriracha chile lime sauce,” on its menu. But in 2017, Applebee’s president John Cywinski reversed course. Amid a 21 percent decline in profit and the closure of as many as 135 restaurants, he signaled a return to the restaurant’s Middle American roots.
Red Lobster hasn’t seen the same dramatic plunge in business, but it hasn’t grown much either (aside from a Beyoncé-inspired uptick in sales in 2016). In 2014, five years after a chainwide remodel and an ill-conceived pairing with Olive Garden, Red Lobster was sold by Darden Restaurants to Golden Gate Capital for $2.1 billion. 
Its menu has changed considerably since then. Last December, Red Lobster added snack-size tasting plates, retooled its regionally inspired dishes and announced the return of its endless shrimp promotion. Recent menu items have included a lobster truffle mac and cheese and whipped sweet potatoes with honey-roasted pecans.
But the crispy lobster and waffles — which Danielle Connor, the senior vice president of menu strategy and development, said was meant to show Red Lobster’s “culinary expertise and menu innovation” — is a dish with more than millennial-focused overtones.
For starters, it was inspired by chicken and waffles, an entree that is part of the trend of soul food items rising from post-reconstruction fare for southern black citizens to post-gentrification fare offered at slick eateries in post-black neighborhoods. And the Cheddar Bay waffle element to the dish was inspired by Red Lobster’s famous Cheddar Bay biscuits. In my home state of Massachusetts, where nationwide seafood chains are hard to come by, those biscuits were the stuff of legends.
My first taste of a Cheddar Bay biscuit took place in August of 2010, after a five-hour drive from Boston to Rutgers University, where I was going to college. After an hour of unpacking, my family was ready for lunch. I suggested we go to the nearby Red Lobster.
The meal was a mixed bag: The biscuits were every bit as amazing as advertised, but my shrimp fettuccine Alfredo made up with hazard what it lacked in taste. I spent the night counting the tiles in my new college bathroom, much to the chagrin of my then-girlfriend, with whom I had made plans. When the Red Lobster defense failed to hold water, she dropped me like a limited-time entree.
My first impression of Red Lobster as a killer of relationships and usurper of gastrointestinal equilibrium didn’t stop me from frequenting the place during my years at Rutgers. I ordered the same four things: margaritas, lagers, artichoke dip and indefensible amounts of Cheddar Bay bread.
One night, I came across a Red Lobster Cheddar Bay biscuit kit at the grocery store. Those first dozen biscuits elevated a college evening of glassy-eyed giggling into what felt like a red carpet affair. The next day, I purchased three more boxes of the biscuit mix. After perfecting the recipe, I made them for a crush. 
Four years later, that same crush, now my wife, was looking at me, across the table, with a leery expression on her face.  
“My stomach might not be ready,” she pleaded as we sat down to order. “We don’t have to do this. We can still go to Popeye’s.” 
But by then Sam, an 18-year-old college freshman, was at our table, greeting us with a nervous smile and a few jokes. He was halfway through his first day as a waiter. We asked about the lobster and waffle special (which, I should mention, was $24.99). 
“It’s our most popular item,” Sam said. “I haven’t tried it yet, but my boss says it’s fire.”
After two baskets of biscuits, Sam cleared our table and served the main course: An amber, slightly burned waffle, glistening atop a thin layer of oil, rested beneath two piping hot, golden brown strips of fried more-shell-than-lobster tail. 
Separately, the lobster tasted much like coconut shrimp; the Cheddar Bay waffle could have been mistaken for a Costco Asiago bagel. In combination, the elements of the meal were a little more unusual.  The smoky, oversweet syrup coupled with salty, tough lobster tasted like maple bacon kettle chips, with an aftertaste reminiscent of warm Guinness. 
“It’s like a burned Cheez-It with syrup,” my wife remarked after her first forkful. “But I don’t hate it like I thought I would.”

Political Memo
Trump Declines First Pitch on Opening Day, Throwing Ritual a Curveball

By Noah Weiland
	April 3, 2017
WASHINGTON — President Trump is not usually one to turn down a big crowd.
But as 43,000 baseball fans gathered for the Washington Nationals’ season opener here on Monday, the city’s most prominent resident was occupied with official duties, declining the team’s invitation to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.
White House officials said Mr. Trump had a scheduling conflict. On Monday afternoon, the president met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt.
“I think he would have gotten a ton of boos in this city, with 94 percent Democrats,” said Chris Faust, a fan at Nationals Park on Monday, referring to the percentage of votes Hillary Clinton received in Washington in November (just over 90 percent). “It would have shattered his ego once and for all.”
In Mr. Trump’s place, the Nationals invited service members from the five military branches — the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines and the Coast Guard — to throw simultaneous first pitches.
Presidential first pitches have been around since 1910, when William Howard Taft was the first to throw one. Jimmy Carter, a well-known Atlanta Braves fan, is the only president since who has not taken part while in office.
But for any president, there is a peril in trying to throw a ball 60 feet six inches in the middle of a packed stadium, hecklers poised.
On opening day in 1986, President Ronald Reagan threw a pitch so wild that he asked for a redo. Even Vice President Dick Cheney got involved: At the Nationals’ opener in April 2006, he was mercilessly booed while he took the mound.
Mr. Trump, who was the captain of his high school baseball team, is not known as a committed baseball fan, much like his predecessor, Barack Obama, who also turned down the offer to throw out the first pitch on opening day during his first year in office.
Mr. Obama did eventually throw one in a Nationals warm-up jacket and a cap for the Chicago White Sox, his favorite team. He flung a rainbow of a pitch at the plate, grinning as the crowd hissed.
And there are times when the demands on presidents go beyond the throw. Mr. Obama, for instance, was ridiculed for wearing what people called “dad jeans” during one pitch. Ari Fleischer, who was President George W. Bush’s press secretary, helped his boss practice in a bulletproof vest before several of his first pitches.
“When it fits a presidential pattern, people come to expect it,” Mr. Fleischer said of the tradition. “It’s a nice way to identify with a lot of ordinary Americans.”
As for Mr. Trump’s decision this week? Mr. Fleischer thinks it was wise.
“Anyone who has ever studied a video of President Obama throwing a baseball knows it’s a high-risk endeavor,” Mr. Fleischer said.
Mr. Obama was not always as unconcerned about his form as he was that day at Nationals Park in 2010. While running for the Senate in 2004, he agreed to throw out the first pitch at a Kane County Cougars minor league game, trying to charm voters. He practiced by throwing to a young campaign aide, David Katz, at Wrigley Field while the Chicago Cubs were out of town.
“The staff was a little nervous because they’d never seen him throw a baseball before,” Mr. Katz said. “All he kept saying was, ‘I have to make sure I don’t bounce it in there.’”
While he cleared that bar, Mr. Obama did not look as rehearsed as he really was.
“The pitch he threw that day could most charitably be described as a parabola,” said David Axelrod, the former White House senior adviser. “The Cougars, who were watching from their dugout, were less charitable.”
There was also a time when a presidential appearance at a ballpark signified more than the start of the season.
Paul Dickson, a co-author of “Baseball: The Presidents’ Game,” has studied how mutually beneficial that relationship between presidents and the game can be.
“It’s bigger than opening day. It’s the president at the ballpark,” he said. “Woodrow Wilson was considered a good luck token for three opening days. Truman was beloved at the park. When he came out in 1946, he was a symbol of the war being over and that baseball was back.”
Tom Holster, the former president of the Washington Baseball Historical Society, recalled a time when a president’s participation on opening day in Washington — when the team was the Senators — was basic to the start of the baseball season.
“The Senators played before anyone else started,” Mr. Holster said. “The president would come out, and that would be the kickoff of the baseball season. The president would inaugurate it.”
Mr. Trump has a more contemporary predicament, Mr. Dickson said, as an “incidental symbolic figure” vulnerable to jeers from government employees unfriendly to the president’s politics.
Some in the crowd on Monday wanted a diversion from the dramas of the new administration. Holly Meyers, a Washington native, was at the first game ever played at Nationals Park in 2008, when Mr. Bush, near a low in popularity, threw out the first pitch to resounding boos.
“I think it’s cruel. I don’t have to put my opinions out there to shame someone publicly,” Ms. Meyers said.
“The less I have to think about the president while I’m at a baseball game, the better,” she added. “I’m not going to politicize my vacation day.”
Mr. Trump has thrown out several ceremonial pitches while wearing a suit and tie. In March 2004, before an exhibition game between the New York Yankees and Houston Astros in Tampa, Fla., he came to the mound and promptly bounced the pitch to the plate.
“You’re fired!” fans shouted at Mr. Trump, then the star of “The Apprentice.”
Even though Mr. Trump remained across town on Monday — missing the Nationals’ 4-2 victory over the Miami Marlins — he had once demonstrated serious, if youthful, interest in the game: He was remembered as a hotheaded grade school player who smashed his bat and dirtied his jersey.
When he was 12, he wrote a poem for his school yearbook in a familiar voice.
“I like to hear the crowd give cheers, so loud and noisy to my ears,” it read. “When the score is 5-5 I feel like I could cry. And when they get another run, I feel like I could die.”

Marisa Merz, Bold Explorer When Art Was a Man’s World, Dies at 93
She was the lone and often overshadowed woman among the central figures of the avant-garde movement in Italy known as Arte Povera. But her day did come.

By Neil Genzlinger
	Aug. 6, 2019
Marisa Merz, an artist who was identified early in her career with the Italian avant-garde movement Arte Povera — the only woman among its main members — before branching out into a wide range of mediums across more than a half-century, died on July 19 in Turin, Italy. She was 93. 
The Fondazione Merz, which is devoted to work by her and her husband, the artist Mario Merz, announced her death.
Ms. Merz was an artistic explorer, working in clay, paint and ink as well as in nontraditional materials. She also ventured into performance and installation art and the written word. 
In the 1960s she made large aluminum hangings and other striking sculptures. In the 1970s she turned to creating small heads of clay, as well as drawings and paintings of female faces. Her first solo New York show, at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in 1994, included about 50 crocheted squares of copper wire.
Early on Ms. Merz was largely overshadowed by her husband, who died in 2003, and the other men of Arte Povera, a movement that started in Italy as a reaction to establishment institutions and whose members liked to use found objects and other nontraditional materials. 
But she came to be recognized as an important figure in the movement, garnering solo exhibitions in Italy and, in 1994, a solo show at the Pompidou Center in Paris. Defying conventional art practices, she often declined to date or title her pieces. 
Ms. Merz had her first retrospective in the United States in 2017, jointly organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, at the Met Breuer in Manhattan. The New Yorker critic Peter Schjeldahl described the show, “Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space,” as “revelatory.” 
“She proved to have been the most appealing artist in an otherwise all-male movement,” he wrote. 
Ms. Merz was born in Turin on May 23, 1926. Her early life is something of a mystery, as critics learned when the New York retrospective opened.
“Her father worked at the Fiat plant,” Mr. Schjeldahl wrote. “She may have studied dance. At some point in the nineteen-forties, she modeled for the neoclassical painter Felice Casorati. I have now conveyed all that is publicly known of Merz’s life before 1960.” 
The critic Germano Celant coined the term Arte Povera (literally, poor art) in 1967 to describe the radical, often minimalist art emerging in Italy in the tumultuous late ’60s. That same year, Ms. Merz had a solo exhibition at the Gallery Gian Enzo Sperone in Turin, an important champion of innovative art. She participated in group shows as well, although, as the curator Ian Alteveer noted in a video made for the Met Breuer exhibition, her importance was not clear at first.
“Throughout those first few years in the later ’60s and into the early ’70s,” he said, “there were many instances where Marisa was not necessarily credited for being part of a show — maybe she decided herself not to participate in an exhibition — and so there was a bit of ambiguity about how involved she was with that movement.”
The art she did make, though, brought a singular sensibility to the movement, incorporating domestic elements and techniques drawn from the women’s craft world, like knitting.
“In her powerful early work, Merz creates from an entirely different place than her male contemporaries: that of a mother,” Anna Tome wrote on the art site hyperallergic.com in 2017. “Her uniquely female experience is mined and celebrated in enigmatic works such as ‘BEA’ (1968), a fragile construction of nylon thread shaped into the name of her daughter.”
If her work had a feminine touch, it could also have a feminist one, as Roberta Smith noted in The New York Times in 2015, when she reviewed a group show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that included a work that Ms. Merz had made a half-century earlier.
“An untitled work from 1966 by the Italian artist Marisa Merz consists of a column of reinforcing wire hung with fat bunches of synthetic blond hair, like so many scalps,” Ms. Smith wrote. “It is a stark yet restrained comment on male domination.”
Ms. Merz also wrote poetry and journals and delved into performance art. In the Met Breuer video, Mr. Alteveer talks about a Merz piece from 1970 that consisted of her being flown in a small airplane; while aloft, he said, she was “reciting a series of numbers and counting the altitude.”
Ms. Merz’s survivors include her daughter, Beatrice Merz,  who heads the Merz foundation. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
Ms. Merz was somewhat reclusive and gave few interviews. The curator and art historian Hans Ulrich Obrist managed to get one in 2009 for Mousse Magazine. Touring her home and studio, he asked about some clay heads that seemed to have been cast aside.
“Oh, junk,” she told him. “Things that don’t have anything to say. But I hold onto them, because every once in a while — voilà! You see them, they become visible, they talk, I see them.”

            Michael Cooper is a reporter who covers classical music and dance for The Times.                        More
        Michael Cooper is a reporter who covers classical music and dance for The Times.
He has written about opera stars, some of whom happen to be sheep; the struggles women face getting work as conductors and choreographers; the comings and goings of leading conductors; and behind-the-scenes tumult at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. His reporting on accusations of sexual misconduct against James Levine, the longtime music director of the Metropolitan Opera, prompted the company to investigate him and ultimately fire him.
Mr. Cooper was previously a national correspondent, a political reporter covering presidential campaigns, and an early believer in writing fact checks to hold candidates accountable. A lapsed musician who joined The Times as a night copy boy, he started out as a metro reporter and worked over the years at the shack, the dingy press room New York’s police headquarters; Room 9, where New York’s City Hall reporters work; and at the Capitol in Albany, where he was the bureau chief. He has also covered the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; the 2000 presidential campaign and its overtime rounds in Florida, plane crashes, hurricanes, an oil spill and other mayhem.His work has been recognized by the New York Press Club, the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, the Society of Silurians, and the Legislative Correspondents Association. Born and raised in New York City, he graduated from Stuyvesant High School and Columbia College.

Trump Throws Middle East Policy Into Turmoil Over Syria
President Trump at the White House last week.Credit...T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times
By Peter Baker and Lara Jakes
	Published Oct. 7, 2019Updated Oct. 14, 2019
WASHINGTON — President Trump threw Middle East policy into turmoil on Monday with a series of conflicting signals after his vow to withdraw American forces from the region touched off an uprising among congressional Republicans and protests by America’s allies.
Defending his decision to clear the way for a Turkish military operation against America’s Kurdish allies in northern Syria, announced in a White House statement on Sunday night, Mr. Trump said it was “time for us to get out” and let others “figure the situation out.”
[Related: Why Turkey is fighting Kurds in Syria, explained.]
But his move touched off a broad rebuke by Republicans, including some of his staunchest allies, in some of the sharpest language they have leveled against a Trump foreign policy decision. And in response, the president pivoted sharply and said he would restrain Turkey.
“As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!),” the president wrote on Twitter. He did not explain what would be off limits, but aides insisted he had not given a green light to an invasion.

Listen to ‘The Daily’: Is the U.S. Betraying Its Kurdish Allies?
Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Rachel Quester and Jonathan Wolfe, with help from Paige Cowett; and edited by M.J. Davis Lin and Lisa Tobin
President Trump’s promise to withdraw troops from Syria could leave one of America’s closest partners in the region more vulnerable to attack.
	michael barbaro
	From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
Today: President Trump said that he would withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border with Turkey, saying, quote, “It is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars” and “bring our soldiers home.” How that decision could lead to the wholesale destruction of one of America’s most loyal allies in the Middle East.
It’s Tuesday, October 8.
Eric, set the scene for us in northern Syria on Monday.
	eric schmitt
	So along the treacherous northern Syrian border with Turkey, United States Special Forces have been moving into small encampments. These are Syrian military outposts, many of them with large concrete watchtowers.
	michael barbaro
	Eric Schmitt covers national security for The Times.
	eric schmitt
	And the special forces in their camouflage gear, their helmets, dark sunglasses, have been moving in, trying to prevent conflict from spilling over into this very dangerous area. But then suddenly, on Monday morning, about two dozen of these troops just suddenly walked off the job, leaving the villagers there puzzled as to what had happened. Why did these soldiers, these American soldiers, leave without any kind of notice?
	michael barbaro
	Right. It’s not every day that an encampment of American troops just leaves without explanation.
	eric schmitt
	No. Not at all — and so the big question was what had happened? Nobody really knew.
	michael barbaro
	So what did happen? What explains why these troops essentially walked off base?
	eric schmitt
	Well, what had happened is —
	archived recording
	Late last night, the White House announced that U.S. troops are beginning a withdrawal.
	eric schmitt
	— the night before, President Trump had ordered them to leave.
	archived recording
	There’s a lot of disappointment here at the Pentagon this morning. U.S. officials tell me they were completely blindsided by the White House order to pull U.S. forces from northern Syria.
	eric schmitt
	And basically —
	archived recording
	This is a major shift with the potential for major national security implications.
	eric schmitt
	— it betrayed a key ally in the region. And it threatened to imperil many of the counterterrorism gains that the United States had made over the last couple of years and hand a moral victory, if not an actual territorial victory, to some of the United States’s key enemies in the region.
	michael barbaro
	So Eric, I wonder if you could just step way back and explain the dynamics here, the forces at play, and how we get to this decision by President Trump. What exactly is going on here?
	eric schmitt
	At the heart of this is really the Kurds. This is a stateless people. And they represent a significant minority in the southeastern part of Turkey. And Turkey sees them as a terrorist group within their own country.
	michael barbaro
	Mm-hmm.
	eric schmitt
	But the Kurds are also a very important ally, or at least some of the Kurds are. In Syria, they’re a key ally to the United States in its fight against the Islamic State in that area. The problem for the United States is how to balance these two partners. One, the stateless entity, Kurds, who are terrific fighters, who prove their mettle in basically kicking ISIS out of northeastern Syria, but are the archenemy of the Turks. The Turks, however, are a longtime, decades-old NATO ally that the United States relies on and has relied on for a long time. It forms a very essential part of security in the region. And the problem for the United States? They’re caught in the middle of this, trying to manage them both to keep them from clashing, which would undermine many of the national security goals the United States has in the region.
	michael barbaro
	So the Kurds and the Turks are sworn enemies. But they are both allies of the United States. So what has been the U.S. policy for navigating those tensions?
	eric schmitt
	The United States has tried to distinguish between the Kurds who are in Turkey and the Kurds who are in northeastern Syria fighting on behalf of the United States. Turkey, however, continues to believe this is a fiction. Kurds are Kurds. They’re all enemies of Turkey.
	michael barbaro
	Hmm.
	eric schmitt
	And they’ve pushed the United States to let them come after Kurds in Northern Syria. The United States said no, no, lay off. Leave them alone. And up to now, the Turks have basically had to honor that. They haven’t dared challenge the United States military that’s there. So as long as American troops are there, the sense is that this conflict will not actually blow up. The U.S. will somehow kind of keep everybody in their corners. That’s right. And that’s the way it had been up until last December.
	archived recording (donald trump)
	There will be a strong, deliberate and orderly withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria — very deliberate, very orderly.
	eric schmitt
	In December, President Trump ordered all 2,000 American forces in Syria out, immediately.
	archived recording
	Immediately, you had the Turkish defense minister talking about massacring the Syrian Kurds, which the Turkish government views as terrorists.
	eric schmitt
	These are the same forces that had been protecting the Syrian Kurds. And suddenly, the U.S. was just walking away, basically leaving them at the mercy of the Turkish army. And this withdrawal triggered outrage.
	archived recording (marco rubio)
	We in this Congress, and we as a nation, are going to be dealing with the consequences of it for years to come.
	eric schmitt
	Not only among Democrats, but among Republicans, among allies who were totally blindsided by the president’s announcement.
	archived recording (lindsey graham)
	This is a disaster in the making. All of his military advisers have said we need to leave troops in Syria to work with the Kurds.
	eric schmitt
	Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, angry that the allies had been blindsided by the president’s lack of consultation with this decision, resigned in protest.
	archived recording
	In his letter of resignation to Mr. Trump, Secretary Mattis wrote that he was leaving because, quote, “you have a right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours.”
	michael barbaro
	And Eric, what about the Kurds? What was their reaction to the U.S. starting to draw down these troops and seemingly start to walk away from them?
	eric schmitt
	Well, you can imagine they were furious. This was an ally, they thought, that was standing beside them, that had stood beside them for years now against Turkey. And suddenly, without any notice at all, they were going to lose their buffer.
	michael barbaro
	So despite this backlash, does President Trump move forward with this decision to pull back the troops?
	eric schmitt
	Well, yes and no. Here’s what’s interesting. The president basically overruled all his national security advisers, who couldn’t believe this had happened. But what happened next was over the next several months, the aides tried to figure out a way to slow down the withdrawal, to mitigate its effects so there wouldn’t be this very abrupt pullout of American troops on the ground in Syria.
	michael barbaro
	Because they essentially disagreed with it or thought that the pace the president outlined was unproductive?
	eric schmitt
	That’s right. The trick was how do you do this without the boss knowing about it and getting angry that his orders aren’t being followed? So by late March, the force had come down to about 1,000 troops. And then the military’s plan was basically to pause there rather than to continue further and just not talk about it a whole lot, hoping the president wouldn’t focus on the extent to which the American military was continuing its operations there. And always telling him, whenever he asked, that we are on a plan to draw down. And they were. They were eventually going to do it. They just maybe weren’t going to do it at the pace that the president initially thought about.
	michael barbaro
	Mm-hmm. So what exactly were the remaining troops actually doing there?
	eric schmitt
	The troops were doing three main things. First, they remained that buffer that we talked about before, between the Turkish military and its Kurdish allies. That was constant.
	michael barbaro
	Mm-hmm.
	eric schmitt
	The second thing they were doing was to help enable the Syrian Kurdish forces carry out counterterrorism operations. Because by this summer, and even up till just recently, ISIS was starting to make a comeback in Syria. So the U.S. still needed these Kurdish fighter networks on the ground to carry out raids and missions to disrupt or capture and kill some of these terrorists.
	michael barbaro
	Mm-hmm.
	eric schmitt
	The third thing they needed the Syrian Kurds to do was continue to detain some 11,000 ISIS fighters that had been captured in the previous battles. And these were held in makeshift prisons, sometimes old schools, warehouses. They weren’t very secure. And so the American military came in and helped put bars on windows and things like that.
	michael barbaro
	Mm-hmm.
	eric schmitt
	So the U.S. needs those Kurdish jailers, if you will, to hold on to these guys. And that’s a huge concern.
	michael barbaro
	O.K. So these sound like crucial U.S. objectives. And I assume that among the U.S. troops carrying them out are these soldiers who walked off these posts over the weekend. So how did we get from America committed to carrying out those three missions to these soldiers leaving those posts?
	eric schmitt
	Well, meanwhile, as the U.S. has been doing its job, Turkey is agitating more and more on its side. You have to remember that Turkey has absorbed hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees over the past several years because of the civil war in Syria. And for President Erdogan, they’re becoming increasingly a political liability. So as he looks across the border, he not only sees his archenemy, the Kurds, who he wants to push back, he also sees an opportunity to carve out an enclave just across the border where he would be able to put hundreds of thousands of these Syrian refugees so they’re no longer his problem — they’re back in Syria. The problem is this territory he’s eyeing is controlled by the Syrian Kurds and their American allies.
	michael barbaro
	Hmm.
	eric schmitt
	So by the beginning of August, he’s threatening to take matters into his own hand and says, I’m just going to invade and unilaterally carve out this district. The Americans say, whoa, wait a minute. Let’s work this out. They’re very worried about any kind of unilateral Turkish operation that pushes deep into Syrian Kurdish territory, that could provoke a clash with these Syrian Kurdish allies they have on the ground, which could imperil U.S. counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State, because the Kurdish allies would be off fighting the Turks. And it could also jeopardize the security of several jails that the Syrian Kurds are holding thousands of ISIS fighters. The Americans fear the worst about what could happen if they don’t head this off.
	michael barbaro
	So it might not just hurt the Kurds. It might prompt the Kurds to become distracted by a war with an invading Turkish army and suddenly no longer be jailing these ISIS fighters. Suddenly, there’s an even bigger problem, which is thousands of ISIS fighters who might be on the run.
	eric schmitt
	Exactly. And that would be a big, big problem for the United States, one they were trying to avoid — until Sunday.
	[music]
	michael barbaro
	We’ll be right back.
So Eric, what actually happens on Sunday?
	eric schmitt
	Well, Erdogan is tired of waiting. So he goes around this process that’s been developed by his own generals and by the American commanders, as well. And he arranges a call with President Trump on Sunday. And at the end of this call, he tells the president, I’m going to invade northern Syria, just like I’ve been threatening to do. And the president, President Trump, basically says, O.K., and gives him the green light.

	In a statement from the press secretary, the Trump administration says that, quote, “Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation.” And —
	michael barbaro
	Why would that be? Why would President Trump concede so quickly and so completely to Erdogan, given that he is outlining a unilateral invasion across the border?
	eric schmitt
	Well, President Trump has always chafed having American troops tied up in these foreign entanglements. So even though his top national security advisers tell him it’s important, in his gut, he wants to get out of these commitments, particularly after he’s already declared that the United States has won over ISIS. They’ve defeated ISIS, at least territorially.
	archived recording (donald trump)
	We have won against ISIS. We’ve beaten them. And we’ve beaten them badly. We’ve taken back the land. And now it’s time for our troops to come back home.
	eric schmitt
	So that’s one reason. But the other reason is we believe that Erdogan, as he’s suggested before, told Trump that he could take care of this terrorist problem, whatever remains of it in that part of Syria. And that has an appeal for Trump, because Trump has complained that it costs a lot of money to help arm and equip these Kurdish fighters. And it costs a lot of money to help improve these makeshift jails that they’re holding all these ISIS fighters in, fighters that European allies won’t take back. And Trump gets very frustrated. And he says so in the White House statement on Sunday night.
	archived recording
	Well, it was a late-night statement released by the White House. They went on to point the finger at some European nations, such as Germany and France, saying that many of these captured ISIS fighters came from there, the U.S. statement saying that European countries refused to take them back. So the U.S. taxpayer will no longer be paying for U.S. forces to be in that vicinity. But let’s just take a look —
	michael barbaro
	But, of course, what it sounds like Erdogan probably didn’t say was that what he’s told President Trump he will be doing will give him a chance to seek something he has long, long wanted, which is a chance to go after the Syrian Kurds who are America’s allies.
	eric schmitt
	That’s right. And it’s that fear — that the United States would not only no longer support the Kurds, but would step back and let the Turkish army pour across the border and slaughter one of its most loyal partners in the fight against ISIS over the last several years — that triggered outrage, even among the president’s most loyal Republican supporters.
	archived recording (brian kilmeade)
	What a disaster. I mean, the president’s statement through Stephanie Grisham is the caliphate is destroyed. We would not have done that without the Kurds, who did all of our fighting. Now we’re saying, O.K., Turks. Go wipe them out, or force them out. What kind of message is that to the next ally that wants to side with us? Meanwhile —
	archived recording (lindsey graham)
	The Kurds stepped up when nobody else would to fight ISIS. If we abandon them, good luck getting anybody to help America in the future with radical Islam, Al Qaeda and ISIS.
	archived recording
	I just spoke to a Kurdish official. He said the Americans have betrayed us. They have opened the door for a Turkish massacre. We are no longer able to fight against ISIS. ISIS might return to the region. And the only one responsible, if that happens, will be the Americans. They are —
	eric schmitt
	Even Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said other hostile powers in the region would also benefit from this. The Russians, the Iranians, the Assad regime in Syria would all be able to take advantage of this power vacuum with the pulling back of the United States.
	michael barbaro
	But despite everything you just said, President Trump is clearly compelled by what Turkey’s president said to him over the phone this past weekend. So does Erdogan have credibility when he makes an argument that Turkey can take care of all the things that the Kurds have been doing for the U.S.? Can Turkey actually do any of that?
	eric schmitt
	No. It’s really hard to believe that Turkish security services, the military, which have had trouble dealing with terrorists in their own country, can carry out an operation in northeastern Syria and take on the ISIS guerrilla networks there. At the same time, presumably, they’d also be fighting Syrian Kurds who are trying to hold on to their homeland. So the argument that Turkey can handle the counterterrorism mission in the northeastern part of the country is really a stretch. But that’s kind of music to the president’s ears.
	michael barbaro
	Why?
	eric schmitt
	Somebody else is going to take over the burden. We’re pulling back. And ultimately, his message is, as he’s said before, we’re pulling out altogether. That’s the goal. That’s his goal, at least.
	michael barbaro
	Eric, you cover the military. You think a lot about U.S. national security. How much does that philosophy from President Trump, how much does that diverge from the dominant view of U.S. foreign policy?
	eric schmitt
	Well, it really flies in the face of nearly two decades’ worth of experience since September 11th. That you need at least a small residual counterterrorism force, whether it’s a combination of military, C.I.A., to combat extremists who pose a threat to the United States and to American interests around the world. It doesn’t have to be a large force, as the United States has demonstrated in northeastern Syria right now. But to pull out altogether and basically wait for the threat of an attack against the United States, that’s not the thinking now. The thinking now is strangle that threat where it lies.
	michael barbaro
	So Eric, what happens now to the Kurds? What do you expect will be their fate over the next couple weeks and months?
	eric schmitt
	So for the Kurds who’ve always been a stateless people, they’ve needed a sponsor, this is truly a dark day. If they’re stripped of their American protection, they obviously face the daunting task of having to confront a Turkish invasion, military invasion. ISIS would probably be emboldened. ISIS would probably attack. So they’d be fighting on at least two fronts. Then you’d have these foreign powers who would be trying to press in for the resources that are in the territory they control. So the Kurds are really in a bad spot if the Americans withdraw completely. But there’s also a broader message to American allies around the world. And that is, just how good is the American word? No matter how valiant an ally or partner you might be, this episode underscores you might end up like the Kurds one day.
You may end up abandoned.

	michael barbaro
	Eric, thank you very much.
	eric schmitt
	Thank you.

	On Monday, Kurdish officials condemned Trump’s decision. In a statement, they wrote, quote, “Our brave men and women” have “just won a historic victory over the ISIS ‘caliphate,’ a victory announced by President Trump and celebrated across the world. To abandon us now would be tragic.” In Washington, both Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress said they would use their power to try to block Turkey from invading Syria. Senators Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen said they would introduce bipartisan legislation to sanction Turkey if it entered Syria, while Senators Chris Murphy and Mitt Romney said they would hold congressional hearings on Trump’s decision as soon as possible. Amid the growing backlash, President Trump seemed to walk back his original message, saying he would now seek to restrain Turkey. In a tweet, the president wrote, quote, “If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.”
We’ll be right back.
Here’s what else you need to know today. In their latest demand for documents, the leaders of the House impeachment inquiry subpoenaed the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget for documents about why the White House withheld nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine. Both a whistle-blower complaint and text messages from senior U.S. diplomats have raised the possibility that Trump withheld the money in order to pressure Ukraine to carry out political favors, including an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. And on Monday, a federal judge rejected President Trump’s effort to shield his tax returns from New York prosecutors, calling the president’s argument that he is immune from such investigations, quote, “repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values.” The New York prosecutors had subpoenaed eight years of Trump’s tax returns over the summer as part of an investigation into hush money the president paid to women who said they had affairs with him, prompting a lawsuit from Trump to block the subpoena. Lawyers for the president immediately appealed Monday’s ruling, which could eventually require him to hand over the returns.
That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.
A Defense Department official said the president’s threat to destroy the Turkish economy should make clear that Mr. Trump had not approved a Turkish attack on the Kurds. “The Department of Defense made clear to Turkey — as did the president — that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria,” Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. “The U.S. armed forces will not support or be involved in any operation.”
But Republicans were not sure. Even after Mr. Trump recalibrated his message, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, warned against “a precipitous withdrawal” that would benefit Russia, Iran, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Islamic State. Mr. McConnell sharply urged the president to “exercise American leadership.”
The president’s pronouncements kept supporters, foreign leaders, military officers and his own aides off balance as they tried to interpret Mr. Trump’s meaning and anticipate its consequences. The president has long agitated to get the United States out of overseas wars, only to be pulled back by the national security establishment and congressional allies.
In this case, Mr. Trump seemed to be responding instinctively to an unexpected comment by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey near the end of a telephone call on Sunday that otherwise focused on trade and defense assistance. Mr. Erdogan, who has long threatened to send troops over the border against Kurdish fighters allied with the United States, told Mr. Trump that he was finally moving forward.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Erdogan that he did not support an incursion, according to aides. But rather than hold back Mr. Erdogan anymore, Mr. Trump got off the call and promptly issued a late-night statement that he would pull out about 50 American special operations troops near the border who have served as a trip wire deterring Turkey from sending forces into Syria.
By Monday morning, he was bombarded with complaints from both Republicans and Democrats, who charged that such a move would abandon the Kurds, some of the United States’ most loyal and effective allies in the region, while emboldening some of America’s most threatening enemies.
[A look at who is affected by Trump’s shift in Syria.]
“This is a big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and usually one of the president’s most vocal backers, said on Fox News. “I will do everything I can to sanction Turkey if they step one foot in northeastern Syria. That will sever my relationship with Turkey. I think most of the Congress feels that way.”

Mr. Graham said he would also introduce a nonbinding resolution asking Mr. Trump to reconsider his move, which he called “shortsighted and irresponsible.” The president’s assertion that the Islamic State has been defeated is “the biggest lie being told by the administration,” Mr. Graham added.
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the House Republican leadership, called withdrawing forces “a catastrophic mistake.” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said it would be “a grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.” Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said, “The President’s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal.”
Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, joined the chorus. “We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,” she tweeted. “The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.”
Left virtually on his own, Mr. Trump found support on Capitol Hill from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and one of the president’s staunchest defenders. The president “once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy,” Mr. Paul tweeted.
Mr. Trump came to office promising to get the country out of overseas wars, contending that the military’s involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had largely been a waste of lives and money, with little to show for it.
A similarly sudden decision last winter to pull American troops out of Syria prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign, and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, accelerated his own planned departure in protest.
The Senate, led by Mr. McConnell, relayed its displeasure in January by voting overwhelmingly to rebuke Mr. Trump over his planned withdrawal of military forces from Syria and Afghanistan.
Mr. Trump later walked back his decision in Syria to some extent, but has been frustrated to not be doing more to extricate the United States from entanglements in the region. His supporters said that the latest move should therefore not be a surprise and that the Kurds had fair warning.
The Kurdish forces in the area, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have been the most reliable American allies in the region for years, a critical element in recapturing territory once controlled by the Islamic State. But Turkey has long considered the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists and has lobbied the United States to abandon support for them.
Mr. Trump’s initial messages on Monday morning focused not on holding back Turkey but on pulling back from the region.
“I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,” Mr. Trump wrote. “WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.”
He offered little sympathy for the fate of America’s Kurdish allies: “The Kurds fought with us,” he wrote, “but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.”
Meeting with reporters later in the day, he recalled his promises to get out of Middle East wars. “I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home and bring them home as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said.
But even as Mr. Trump talked in global terms, administration officials stressed the limited nature of the current action. Special operations troops near the border will be relocated in coming days, but the total 1,000 troops in Syria would not immediately come home.
Mr. Trump has been particularly irritated that the United States continues to pay to detain thousands of Islamic State fighters captured in recent years. For months, he has tried to pressure European states and others to take those fighters who originated from there, only to run into strong resistance.
“We said, ‘Take them back’ and unfortunately, like NATO, they take advantage,” Mr. Trump told reporters.
But if Turkey moves against the Kurds, the S.D.F. could abandon camps to fight the Turks, potentially allowing some 10,000 captured Islamic State fighters, including 2,000 foreigners, to escape. A senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under administration ground rules said Mr. Trump told Mr. Erdogan that if he did send in troops, they would be responsible for securing the prisoners.
The United States has suspended longstanding efforts to create a safe zone in Syria near the Turkish border that would have kept Turkish forces and Syrian fighters at a distance from each other. But another administration official said that the United States was now controlling the air space over northeast Syria in part to prevent Turkish aggression.
The prospect that an American withdrawal would lead to a Turkish incursion alarmed European allies. The French and Germans issued statements expressing deep concern. A State Department official said the international reaction to a possible Turkish operation had been “devastating” and acknowledged it would destabilize the region.
For now at least, the Syrian Defense Forces leadership has told American officials that it will continue to detain the Islamic State fighters and their families in makeshift camps in northern Syria. But a State Department official acknowledged that the best-trained guards could be pulled away in the event of conflict with Turkey.
Most of the camps are farther south than where the Turkish forces have indicated they might go in Syria, outside the boundary of even the broadest safe zone that has been discussed. If the Kurdish guards flee advancing Turkish forces, the official said, then the administration expects the Turks to take over the detention centers.
American counterterrorism specialists said on Monday that transferring counterterrorism responsibilities to a Turkish military force that has proved ill trained and ill equipped to conduct such operations in their own country would be disastrous and potentially reverse important victories by American troops and their Kurdish partners on the ground.
“It’s hard to imagine Turkey has the capacity to handle securely and appropriately the detainees long held by the Syrian Kurds — and that’s if Turkey even genuinely intends to try,” said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council under Mr. Obama.
“The release or escape of such detainees,” he added, “would instantly energize ISIS’s efforts, already underway, to regroup and surge again.”

5 Ways Facebook Shared Your Data
For years, Facebook gave many large technology companies special access to users’ information. Here’s how it worked.
By Jennifer Valentino-DeVries
	Dec. 19, 2018
Facebook for years gave major tech companies, including Yahoo and Netflix, greater access to people’s data than it disclosed, a New York Times investigation found. The partnerships helped Facebook draw new users, ramp up its advertising revenue and embed itself on sites across the web.
This is how some of the key deals worked.
Yahoo

A "facebar" topping the Yahoo News site showed users' Facebook friends and articles they had read.
In 2011, when Yahoo and Facebook announced their partnership, social networking features were seen as crucial to attracting users to existing websites. In a news release that September, Yahoo announced that it was “putting people’s friends front and center to usher in an innovative way of connecting around content socially.” 
Yahoo said people who opted in to its new features would see their Facebook friends and the articles those friends had read, in a “facebar” at the top of the Yahoo News site. 
As with many social features from that time, the integration did not work as well as the companies had hoped, and it soon ended. Yet Yahoo maintained special data access for more than 80,000 accounts, according to internal Facebook documents reviewed by The Times. As recently as this summer, Yahoo was able to view a stream of posts from these people’s friends, and it is unclear what the company did with that information. A Yahoo spokesman said the company did not use the information for advertising.
Netflix and Spotify
Netflix and Spotify received access to people’s Facebook messages as part of features that allowed people to suggest movies, TV shows and music to friends. On Netflix, for example, after watching a show, a viewer would be prompted to connect to Facebook and recommend it.
Netflix promoted the arrangement in 2014 as more privacy-sensitive than posting people’s viewing habits on their Facebook pages. Using Facebook Messenger allowed people to “easily, and privately, recommend the shows you love to the people you care about,” Netflix said in a 2014 blog post.
To accomplish such sharing, the Netflix application had to be able to send Facebook messages. But Netflix was given the ability not only to send private messages but also to read, write and delete them, and to see all participants on a thread. A Netflix spokesman said the company was not aware it had been granted such broad powers and had used the access only for messages sent by the recommendation feature.
Netflix deactivated the feature about a year after it was introduced, but documents show that the company still had access to users’ messages in 2017. 
Spotify, which continues to offer its own similar recommendation feature, also said it was unaware of the special access.
‘Instant Personalization’
Facebook, in a quest to bind other corners of the web to its social network, shared data with several major websites in a program called “instant personalization.” These partners, which included Microsoft’s Bing search engine and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, got access to users’ names, gender, profile photos and any other information they had made public.
Beginning in 2010, if people visited one of those partner sites while logged in to Facebook, a blue bar on the screen would let them know the site was receiving their Facebook data to personalize what they saw. For example, people might see what movies their friends liked, or get tailored search results based on preferences gleaned from Facebook.
Facebook eventually wound down instant personalization, but it continued to allow some sites, including Bing and Rotten Tomatoes, access to much of the same data they had been getting for the discontinued feature.
‘People You May Know’
The internal documents shed light on a Facebook feature called “People You May Know,” a friend-suggestion tool that has long confused and unsettled users. 
Gizmodo and other outlets have reported that the tool has recommended connections between patients of the same psychiatrist, estranged family members and people who had simply been in the same location, prompting suspicions that the company was closely tracking users’ whereabouts, listening to their conversations and more. 
In some deals, Facebook shared information with other companies and in turn received people’s contact details — data Facebook used to develop complex friend network models and suggest more connections, the documents show. The partners that fed information to the tool included Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei.
The New York Times
The Times, one of nine media companies named in the documents, developed a social-sharing application called TimesPeople in 2008.
The tool incorporated Facebook friend lists and allowed people to share articles and make recommendations to other readers. The feature was shut down in 2011, but The Times continued to have access to friend lists until 2017. The Times spokeswoman said they were unaware of the continued access and were not receiving any data for the feature from Facebook.

Do You Wear Clothes for the Logo?
Celebrating Fendi Mania at the Fendi store on Madison Avenue.Credit...Amy Lombard for The New York Times
By Jeremy Engle
	Nov. 20, 2018
Look at the clothing you are wearing now: Are the brand logos visible? Do logos influence what you wear?
In “What Gives the Logo Its Legs,” Ruth La Ferla explores the growing trend toward bigger, bolder logos on clothing:
At a party last month, Gabriela Silvarolli embraced the full Fendi.
Ms. Silvarolli, a stylist and designer, was swathed from her chin to her calves in the company’s signature double FF logo. Her turnout was excessive, she knew.
“As recently as a year ago, you didn’t wear logos,” she said. “You had to be discreet.”
But a glance at the crowd at Fendi’s Madison Avenue flagship — matrons, films stars and assorted style-world moguls tricked out in Fendi logo regalia — persuaded her otherwise. “Nowadays everything is allowed,” Ms. Silvarolli said. “Nothing is too much.”
Fendi is among the latest in a raft of luxury labels to advance the proposition that too much is never enough. Emboldened by the success of logo-ridden skate wear brands like Palace and Supreme, high-end labels including Prada, Balenciaga, Valentino and Chanel have joined the stampede, their monograms stamped on everything from hats to hosiery and, with a nod to the 1990s, the elastic bands of men’s skivvies.
The article continues:
So what gives logos their staying power?
For starters, the look is being reimagined in a way that speaks expressly to the young. “Chanel, Fendi and others have obviously seen a huge amount of social currency in appealing to a millennials and Generation Z,” Ms. Ross said. Those bands of streetwise consumers flaunt initialed T-shirts, boots, sneakers, belts and totes with a dash of irony.
“For a brand, this may not be the most subtle marketing strategy,” she added, “but companies see that it’s working.”
Fendi, taking a page from street wear, plans to drop limited-edition logo-stamped products at regular intervals. “We like the idea of limited editions,” said Silvia Venturini Fendi, the creative director of accessories and men’s wear at the label. “Younger consumers like that you can get the item, then it’s gone, making way for something new. For us, it’s a way of not being predictable.”
It concludes:
For now, the trend retains its relevance, firmly rooted in its time. Social media is its driver, the logos resonating with those selfie addicts who like to flash their heavily monogrammed trophies on Snapchat and Instagram, their status readily identifiable on an image the size of a postage stamp.
But status is not the only draw. Younger people are adopting logos to signal their allegiance to a tribe or cause, said Milton Pedraza, the founder and chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a consulting firm in New York. Flashing Gucci double G’s can be read as a homage to the company, which has publicly championed gender fluidity and turned its back on fur.
“For youthful fans, the Gucci logo is a tag, a way of stating, ‘I am socially responsible,’” Mr. Pedraza said. “It gives you a very clear identity that goes beyond a fashion statement.”
Students, read the entire article, then tell us:
— Do you wear clothes for the logo? What clothes with logos do you wear and why?
— Take a look at the clothes featured in the article: Would you wear any of them? Are any logos too big or too much for you?
— Have you ever tried to hide a logo on a piece of clothing? Why?
— Do your friends wear clothing with logos? Do you ever feel pressure to keep up with what students at your school are buying and wearing? Do you ever feel judged if you’re not wearing brands with prominent logos? Do you ever judge others by the brands they wear?
— What message do you think your clothes send? Do you believe that wearing logos is a form of self-expression or a form of conformity?
— How do you feel about designers saying that Generation Z and millennials inspire them to create their clothing with big logos? Are you flattered by this? Or do you think they are misunderstanding or exploiting youth culture?
Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.
